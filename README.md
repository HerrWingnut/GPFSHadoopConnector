GPFSHadoopConnector
===================

IBM GPFS (General Parallel File System) Hadoop connector was designed to allows Hadoop to access data from a GPFS filesystem as a replacement to HDFS. It serves as an adaptor between Hadoop and GPFS mapping Hadoop/HDFS APIs to GPFS APIs so as to provide Hadoop/HDFS compatibility. Users may download it to work with IBM GPFS to replace HDFS in their Hadoop systems.
