GPFSHadoopConnector
===================

IBM GPFS (General Parallel File System) Hadoop connector was designed to allows Hadoop to access data from a GPFS filesystem as a replacement to HDFS. It serves as an adaptor between Hadoop and GPFS mapping Hadoop/HDFS APIs to GPFS APIs so as to provide Hadoop/HDFS compatibility. Users may download it to work with IBM GPFS to replace HDFS in their Hadoop systems.

The GPFS Hadoop connector open source process is still ongoing. Please stay tune...
